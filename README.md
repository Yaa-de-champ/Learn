# Learn 
👩‍🔬 - Something small about me: I am a very curious learner, I love to explore outside my field of studies (Biomedical Engineering).
👩‍ - This repository contains lines of codes and other resources I acquired from tutorial sessions or trainings organised by big companies like  google, microsoft, IBM and many more, while my main or master repository [Yaachamp](https://github.com/Yaa-de-champ/Yaachamp), also contains knowlegde and resources I have acquired so far from these companies and also lines of code I personally generated to test myself on the knowlegde I have acquired.
👩‍💻 - This repository will involve languages like python and fields like data science. There will be web development projects with languages like html, javascript and css.
